\## What is Silver Lining?

Silver Lining is an alternate timeline modpack based on Early Release (b1.8-r1.6.4) Minecraft. Inspired by Reminiscence, Better Than Adventure and Authentic Adventure.



Leaning into early modded feel, it has custom world generation (30 biomes), seasons, and a whole lot more. It takes after general design philosophies from early modding, with the niceness and polish of modern modding.
